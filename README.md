# About 

The main objective of this project was to identify different colors in an image using OpenCV. For this we used cv2.KMeans algorithm to identify colors like white, pink, red, green, and yellow.

# What is deltaE_cie76?

Î”E - (Delta E, dE) The measure of change in visual perception of two given colors. Delta E is a metric for understanding how the human eye perceives color difference. The term delta comes from mathematics, meaning change in a variable or function. The suffix E references the German word Empfindung, which broadly means sensation.

The formula for deltaE_cie76 was given by CIE in 1976 and is given by:-
